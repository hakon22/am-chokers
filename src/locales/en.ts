        3: 'our jewelry loves to be in the spotlight, not subjected to rough handling. Remove rings when washing dishes or cleaning, otherwise instead of shine you may get lost stones or bent chains. Our masterpieces can‚Äôt afford such adventures!',
        4: '2. Store with love!',

Let each piece breathe and feel like a star of your collection. Necklaces and chokers are best hung on a hook instead of keys, so they won‚Äôt lose their shape',
